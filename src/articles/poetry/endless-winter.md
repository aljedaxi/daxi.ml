night blankets

so the snow shelters the grass

so the street lights shimmer the snow

until the night smothers the light in your eyes

&nbsp;

neo-liberated child:

the lawn lays its language down before you,

all streets stretch out, stretch ever on, unto thee.

&nbsp;

the window wont openâ€”not all the way, no. no way out in a fire. no escape but death.

sleep never comes.

&nbsp;

my dream slumbers, somewhere,

out in that night. black paint chipping,

cutting off a black canvas.

&nbsp;

then the snow lights the street light.

&nbsp;

you are free to watch.

&nbsp;

the night drags you on. you close your eyes,

but snow sneaks in.

snow stings your eyes. your sheets swell up with space. stars catch your eyes. snow is shoveled in your eyes, coated in black paint. black paint chips behind your eyelids. your tear ducts well up with ink. your bed fills with ink. the stars swim away. your room fills with ink. your window goes black with ink. you drown in ink. the window chips and the snow learns to sink in ink. you drift into the arms of snow, safe,

until the light learns to smother the night in your eyes
