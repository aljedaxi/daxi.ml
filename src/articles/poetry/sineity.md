sinuous
sight springs; light lilts;
matte clouds encoil the cyan left limping; washed, white, away
from feeling
to feel one has seen this sight
roiling hills of black powder,
now black,
now black,
now sight savours shape; orange opens edges of ink washed white, ragged before the majesty of
spotty sights sinew;
gilding, glamorous lightning lays low little night
the darkness roils on around the
sinuous
