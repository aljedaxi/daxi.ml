## or: a measured response to [an article i didn't like](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/self-fulfilling-prophecy-of-react)

first thing to do is to get at what react is. its quidditas must be thought together with its [haecceitas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haecceity#Haecceity_vs._quiddity), if we're to rail against it.

### what is a thing?

drinking with friends is a different thing from drinking alone. abusing alcohol is another thing altogether. yet they all share the same motions; the same substance enters the brain and the liver.

there are a few things this mechanistic apophantic perspective ignores:
* even within on this mechanistic-apophantic paradigm^[i think the kids call it techno-science these days?], this understanding ignores the ways in which mental states---which can be understood as "hormones" or "brain-states"---effect alcohol uptake, and its effects^[you could say that factoring in hormones takes us out of the techno-scientific paradigm proper and into cybernetics &amp;câ€”but, uh, that's not really what this is about so i'm not going to dig into the minutiae here. also, [the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism#cite_note-30)].
* as noted in the apophantic part, you're working backwards from reality, rather than working forwards from your experience (which is bad science tbh)

let's say that a hammer is a thing. a hammer in front of me is a thing. I pick up this hammer. I know how to pick up hammers because i've seen other people do it, or i know that tools tend to have handles that look a certain way, or are made of a certain material. i know what the business end is for similar reasons. i know the *business* of the hammer because by being, and the being of "hammer", are linguistically embedded. we dwell in language. this is unavoidable: when i go to hammer, or to a hammer, i go into this.

so when *i* speak of "React", i'm not speaking of only the react source code. what i'm speaking of, and what i deal with every day at my job in a react house, are interfaces, or, uh, mental models. all of this comes from my interactions with the react docs, with the fandom (in particular, Kent C Dodds), with transferred concepts from javascript at large, &amp;c.
