<pre>
two faces; no eyes; no mouth; nostrils; no
escaping; they fall
multiply, multip-ly, multiplicious, mulling
over heels ;they fall; they
can muster the might to make a poem;pulling
no work;they fall
into the poetry; into the sound of
an empire of doldrums; of swirlll
lllllllllloflllllllllofllllofllllllllllling
solitude; they fall, they fall, they fall, they
fall; they fall into falling into falling
into swirling into falling into

(what is required is) an act of will.
</pre>
