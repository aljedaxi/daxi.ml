## on the question

every once in a while, the flavour of my first kiss forces itself into my mouth. thoughts float in and out; they must be caught and pinned---or perhaps it is myself that is caught and pinned, and the thoughts continue to flow, as data flows through functions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8">how do you solve a problem like ...</a>? even very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well">simple</a> programs like `grep` solve infinite numbers of problems. 10,000 concerned people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Ready-to-hand">reach for</a> the program to solve 10,000 problems; 10,000 effects become 10,000 causes in the next stage of the pipeline. 10,000 people reach for `grep`, then `awk`, then `grep` again. mission creeps.

fortunately, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany_paramilitary_ranks">Brownshirts</a> have <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">slouched their way into Bethlehem</a>. the simplest form of simplicity is to <a href="https://archive.org/details/DesigningFreedom_CBC_Lectures">shoot the cat</a>, pluck the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6-P3pFhmQI">flower</a> from the hands of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Sermon">Buddha</a>, regress toward the mean, <a href="https://3teeth.bandcamp.com/track/final-product">market</a>.

i find this concerning. i'm concerned with writing this against that.

a classical problem: you are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TSOvYHMrU">10,000 things</a> to <a href="https://wolfparade.bandcamp.com/track/lazarus-online">10,000 people</a>. this thing---these words---is 10,000 things; <a href="https://wolfparade.bandcamp.com/album/cry-cry-cry">i</a> am alienated from you, who are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue)#Discussion_of_rhetoric_and_writing_(257c%E2%80%93279c)">probably pretty confused while reading</a> this. a *qoute-unquote* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-form#Generalized_commodity_production">generalized commodity</a> is produced and sent out into a unknown world-void.  this generalization is the simplification spoken of above: a *quote-unquote* universalisation, *quote-unquote* object[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophantic">ive</a>]ification, the *quote-unquote* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophantic">apophantic statement</a>, torn from its context.  likewise, as much as pre-drinking is great (i have a vast an delicious collection which no club can parallel), it's also a wonderful way to over drink, without knowing you've overdrank. 

knowing now that we can't do anything without first doing everything, we're left at an impasse, because that everything contains the anything we initially intended to do. the horror. fortunately, the programmers have (perhaps by accident) found the correct knife to separate the question of what and how to question:

Concern.
