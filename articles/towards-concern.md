## on the question

every once in a while, the flavour of my first kiss forces itself into my mouth. thoughts float in and out; they must be caught and pinned---or perhaps it is myself that is caught and pinned, and the thoughts continue to flow, as data flows through functions. [how do you solve a problem like ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8)? even very [simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well) programs like `grep` solve infinite numbers of problems. [10,000](https://web.archive.org/web/20070817180923/http://www.thebigview.com/tao-te-ching/chapter34.html) concerned people [reach for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heideggerian_terminology#Ready-to-hand) the program to solve 10,000 problems; [10,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad) effects become 10,000 causes in the next stage of the pipeline. 10,000 people reach for `grep`, then `awk`, then `grep` again. mission creeps.

fortunately, the [Brownshirts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany_paramilitary_ranks) have [slouched their way into Bethlehem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming). the simplest form of simplicity is to [shoot the cat](https://archive.org/details/DesigningFreedom_CBC_Lectures), pluck the [flower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6-P3pFhmQI) from the hands of the [Shakyamuni Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Sermon), regress toward the mean, [market](https://3teeth.bandcamp.com/track/final-product).

i find this concerning. i'm concerned with writing this *against* that.

a classical problem: you are [10,000 things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1TSOvYHMrU) to <a href="https://wolfparade.bandcamp.com/track/lazarus-online">10,000 people</a>. this thing---these words---is 10,000 things; <a href="https://wolfparade.bandcamp.com/album/cry-cry-cry">i</a> am alienated from [you, who are](https://youtu.be/RfGyJ5zz938?t=3131) probably pretty confused while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue)#Discussion_of_rhetoric_and_writing_(257c%E2%80%93279c)">reading</a> this. a *qoute-unquote* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-form#Generalized_commodity_production">generalized commodity</a> is produced and [sent out into an unknown world-void](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfGyJ5zz938).  this generalization is the simplification spoken of above: a *quote-unquote* universalisation, *quote-unquote* object[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophantic">ive</a>]ification, the *quote-unquote* [apophantic statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophantic), torn from its context.

context in the real world means feedback^[&amp; selection pressures, &amp;c.]: it's very easy to overdrink when you're predrinking, a world away from the club, the heat, the motion and the vomit.

knowing now that we can't do anything without first doing everything, we're left at an impasse, because that everything contains the anything we initially intended to do. the horror. fortunately, the programmers have (perhaps by accident) found the correct knife to separate the question of what and how to question:

Concern.

brownshirts march in. that's what they do. case in point:

"climate change isn't something worth being concerned over. we [someone else] will fix it [for coastal cities] with tech." it's a concern for another. that big picture is for another; my big picture (just as big) is discovering how tech can solve the problem of another industry. my small picture is discovering how tech can solve this.

but to focus on the minutiae of the black experience is to overcomplicate things. racism is being racist---slurs. microaggressions are beyond the scope of my concerns; a picture just as big, but other, another. my big picture is the horror of my impending cancellation.
