## To be concerned

every once in a while, the flavour of my first kiss forces itself into my mouth. thoughts float in and out; they must be caught and pinned---or perhaps it is myself that is caught and pinned, and the thoughts continue to flow, as data flows through functions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-VRyQprlu8">how do you solve a problem like ...</a>? even very simple programs like `grep` solve infinite numbers of problems. 10,000 concerned people reach for the program to solve 10,000 programs; 10,000 effects become 10,000 causes in the next stage of the pipeline. 10,000 people reach for `grep`, then `awk`, then `grep` again. mission creeps.

fortunately, the Brownshirts have slouched their way into Bethlehem. the simplest form of simplicity is to <a href="https://archive.org/details/DesigningFreedom_CBC_Lectures">shoot the cat</a>, pluck the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6-P3pFhmQI">flower</a> from the hands of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_Sermon">Buddha</a>, regress toward the mean, <a href="https://3teeth.bandcamp.com/track/final-product">market</a>.

i find this concerning. i'm concerned with writing this against that.
